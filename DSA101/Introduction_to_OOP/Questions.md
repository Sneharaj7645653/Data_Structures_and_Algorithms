## Problem Description
Construct a class `Circle` that represents a Circle.

The class should support the following functionalities:
- `perimeter()` -> returns the perimeter of the circle
- `area()` -> returns the area of the circle

**Note:** Assume Î  (pi) = 3.14 for calculations.

### Input Format:
- First argument A is an integer representing the number of testcases.
- For each case, the radius `r` is taken as input in a new line.

### Output Format:
The perimeter and area of the constructed circle is printed.

### Sample Input:
```
2     # number of cases
1     # radius of first case
2     # radius of second case
```  

### Sample Output:
```
6.28     # perimeter of first case
3.14     # area of first case
12.56    # perimeter of second case
12.56    # area of second case
```

## Problem Description
Construct a class `Rectangle` that represents a rectangle.

The class should support the following functionalities:
- `perimeter()` -> returns the perimeter of the rectangle
- `area()` -> returns the area of the rectangle

### Input Format:
- First argument A is an integer representing the number of testcases.
- For each case, `x` (length) and `y` (breadth) are taken as input in new lines.

### Output Format:
The perimeter and area of the constructed rectangle are printed.

### Sample Input:
```
1   # number of cases
1   # length of rectangle
2   # breadth of rectangle
```  

### Sample Output:
```
6   # perimeter of rectangle
2   # area of rectangle
```
