# Programming Exercises

## Q1. Class Matrix


Construct a class called **Matrix** which stores a 2D Array. It should
store:

-   The number of rows\
-   The number of columns\
-   The 2D Array itself

Implement the following functionalities inside this class:

-   `input()` -\> Reads the input from the user. This method should read
    the input from the user and populate the entire array. Each row will
    be in a new line and all the elements in a row will be
    space-separated.\
-   `add(Matrix)` -\> Returns the sum of two matrices. Assume the
    matrices provided have the same dimensions.\
-   `subtract(Matrix)` -\> Returns the difference of two matrices.
    Assume the matrices provided have the same dimensions.\
-   `transpose()` -\> Returns a new matrix containing the transpose of
    the given original matrix.\
-   `print()` -\> Prints the entire matrix row by row. Each row will be
    in a new line and values in each row should be separated by a single
    space.

You may define any properties in the class as you see appropriate.

## Q2. Build myfloat


Construct a class **myfloat** where it will have two instance variables:
**whole** and **fraction**. Implement a function to add two myfloats.

**Constraint:**\
- `0 <= fraction <= 9`\
- Floats are expected to be up to one decimal place.\
- The inputs of whole and fractions are integers.\
- The output is expected in the mentioned format: e.g., `2.3`

## Q3. Matrix Class


Create a class named **Matrix** with the following attributes:\
- Number of rows\
- Number of columns\
- 2D array representation

Implement the following functionalities within the class:\
- `input()` -\> This method reads input from the user to populate the
  entire array. Each row is entered on a new line, and elements within a
  row are space-separated.\
- `multiply(Matrix)` -\> This method returns the product of two
  matrices, assuming they can be multiplied.\
- `diagonalDifference()` -\> This method calculates and returns the
  absolute difference between the sum of the primary diagonal and the sum
  of the secondary diagonal. If the diagonal does not exist (e.g., in a
  non-square matrix), it returns `-1`.\
- `print()` -\> This method prints the entire matrix column by column.
  Each column is displayed on a new line, and values within each column
  are separated by a single space.

You may define any properties in the class as you see appropriate.
