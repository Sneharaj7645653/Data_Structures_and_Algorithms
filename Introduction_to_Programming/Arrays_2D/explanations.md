# 📚 Revision Notes: Matrix Operations in Software Engineering

## 1️⃣ Matrix Multiplication ✖️

### 🧠 Understanding Matrix Multiplication
- **📏 Dimensions Compatibility:** To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second.  
  Example: If matrix **A** is *P x Q*, matrix **B** must be *Q x R*, resulting in matrix **C** of dimensions *P x R*.
- **📌 Element Calculation:** Each element `c[i][j]` in **C** is found by taking the **dot product** of the *i-th row* of **A** and the *j-th column* of **B**.

### ⚙️ Algorithm
1. **Initialize**: Create result matrix **C** (*P x R*) filled with zeros.
2. **Nested Loops**:
    - Loop `i` from 0 → P (rows of A)
    - Loop `j` from 0 → R (columns of B)
    - Inside, loop `k` from 0 → Q for dot product.
3. **Calculate**:  
   `c[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]`
4. **Return** the filled matrix **C**.

## 2️⃣ Matrix Transposition 🔄

### 💡 Concept
- **Definition**: Swap rows with columns — element `(i, j)` becomes `(j, i)`.

### 🖥️ Implementation
- **Loop** through only **upper triangle** (above diagonal).
- Outer loop: `i` from 0 → rows.
- Inner loop: `j` from `i+1` → columns.
- **Swap** `a[i][j]` ↔ `a[j][i]`.

## 3️⃣ Rotating an Image (2D Matrix) by 90° 🖼️

### 🔄 Process
1. **Transpose** the matrix (use above method).
2. **Reverse each row**:
    - For clockwise rotation, reverse rows after transpose.
    - Use two-pointer technique to swap elements.

✅ Final Result: Rotated 90° clockwise.

## 4️⃣ Practical Applications 🌍
- 🎨 **Graphics**: Image transformations & effects.
- 📊 **Data Structures**: Grids, adjacency matrices.
- 🗺️ **Algorithms**: Pathfinding in 2D maps.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Feature representation.
