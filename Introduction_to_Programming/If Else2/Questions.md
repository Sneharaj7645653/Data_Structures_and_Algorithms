Given the number N, Categorise the number according to the following condition:
1. Odd-Positive
2. Odd-Negative
3. Even-Positive
4. Even-Negative

**Note**: Intention of problem is to teach you Nested If-Else, so try to solve this problem using nested if-else.

**Problem Constraints**  
-10000 <= N <= 10000 except 0

**Input Format**  
Take Number in single line.

**Output Format**  
Print the statement, according to number N in single line.

**Example Input**  
Input 1 :  
15  
Input 2 :  
-38

**Example Output**  
Output 1 :  
Odd-Positive

## Q2. Relation of 18 with N

**Problem Description**  
Given a Number N, according to situation of N print the output.  
Situations of N are:
- if N is greater than 18, print "N is Greater than 18"
- Otherwise if N is less than 18, print "N is smaller than 18"
- Otherwise Print "N is equal to 18".

**Note**: Intention of this problem is to teach you use of else-if so try to solve it using else-if.

**Problem Constraints**  
-10000 <= N <= 10000

**Input Format**  
Take value of N in an int variable

**Output Format**  
Print situation of N in single line accordingly.

**Example Input**  
Input 1 :  
29  
Input 2 :  
18  
Input 3 :  
-45

**Example Output**  
Output 1 :  
N is Greater than 18  
Output 2 :  
N is equal to 18  
Output 3 :  
N is smaller than 18

**Example Explanation**  
Input N is 29, which is greater than 18.  
Input N is 18, which is equal to 18.

## Q3. Calculate Attendance

**Problem Description**  
Exams are near and Rahul is worried whether he will be allowed to take the exams or not.  
A student is not allowed to take the exams if his/her attendance is less than 75%.  
But Rahul is a little weak in math, so he wants your help to tell him whether he will be able to give exams or not.  
You are given the total number of classes held (T) and number of classes attended by Rahul (N), print YES or NO.

**Problem Constraints**  
1 <= T <= 1000  
1 <= N <= 1000

**Input Format**  
First line is T means total classes.  
Second line is N means classes attended by Rahul.

**Output Format**  
Print YES if Rahulâ€™s attendance is >= 75%, otherwise print NO

**Example Input**  
150  
100

**Example Output**  
NO

**Example Explanation**  
T = 150, N = 100  
Attendance = (100 / 150) * 100 = 66.66%  
Attendance is less than 75%, so the output is NO.
