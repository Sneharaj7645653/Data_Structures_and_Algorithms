# 📘 Introduction to Programming – DSA Practice

Welcome to my repository for documenting my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), built with clarity, structure, and learning in mind.

## 🧠 Purpose

This is a beginner-friendly, well-structured DSA journal where each topic is broken down into:

- **Questions** – properly formatted Markdown files describing the problem  
- **Explanations** – reasoning and logic written clearly for review  
- **Solutions** – Java implementations for each problem
